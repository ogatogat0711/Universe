# Procedural Celestial Body Materials

Thank you for downloading this asset!

## Sample Scenes
You can find two sample scenes in the Samples folder:

1. Space Objects Sample Scene - shows 9 sample celestial bodies - 3 stars and 6 gas giants, some with asteroid rings.
2. 3D Skybox Sample Scene - shows a 3D Skybox set up using some of the celestial body prefabs.

You can explore these to see how to use the materials and prefabs in your own projects. All the prefabs in the Samples folder are ready to use and can be dragged into your own scenes.

## 3D Skybox
The 3D Skybox implementation uses custom render passes and stencil overrides, which are set-up in the URP Asset provided in the Samples folder.

These asset and renderer will be laoded automatically when you open the 3D Skybox Sample Scene.

For the custom passes to work correctly, the 3D Skybox objects need to be placed in a specific layer. In the samples, this is the last layer, with index 31. When importing this asset into a fresh project, the layer field will show up empty on these objects, but will be applied correctly. For more information on how to set up the 3D Skybox, check out the online documentation.

## URP Settings
To get the exact visuals from the preview images - shadows, tonemapping and bloom - they are applied from URP settings, samples of which can also be found in the Samples folder.
